    WELCOME TO Jordan
  </h2>
<h3>
<P>
<a href = "http://international.visitjordan.com/page/2/generalinformation.aspx">Jordan</a> is a land steeped in history. It has been home to some of Humankind's earliest settlements and villages; harboring hidden relics from the world's great civilizations.
As the crossroads of the Middle East, the lands of Jordan and Palestine have served as a strategic nexus; connecting Asia, Africa, and Europe.  Since the dawn of civilization, Jordan's geography has given it an important role as a conduit for trade and communications; connecting the orient with the west. Jordan continues to play a critical role in geopolitical affairs.
